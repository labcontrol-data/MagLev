# MagLev
============

This page provides information about the project developed in the Department of Mathematics, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-BarcelonaTech (ESEIAAT), 08222 Terrassa, Spain, called MagLev. Experiments were carried out in practice in a laboratory testbed, and the data contained in this Github repository were collected in those experiments. The paper ["Semi-Active Magnetic Levitation System for Education"](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/12/5330) describes the details of this experiment.
